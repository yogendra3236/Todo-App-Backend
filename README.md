# Todo-React-App-Backend

This is the backend of my Todo-Frontend App that has been built on ReactJS. [Here](https://github.com/yogendra3236/Todo-React-App) is the link of my frontend repository.
In this Backend part, I have used Axios-API to fetch and send data to the frontend and vice-versa. I have used ExpressJS to do so. I have also used JWT-authentication to verify the user. However, I didn't make any signup endpoint. Only Login endpoint is there.
<br>
In this App, you can add, edit, delete and mark your Todo as done/undone.

### Requirements and Installation

First, open your terminal, and type, `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies onto your system. <br>
Next, type `npm start` to start your *localhost* server on Port 4000. <br>
Now, you need to start your Frontend server, that has been maintained at Port 3000. Now, you're ready to go. <br>

Happy Coding :)
